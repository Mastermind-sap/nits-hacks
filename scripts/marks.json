Meditation can give you a sense of calm, peace and balance that can benefit your emotional well-being and your overall health.”\n---\n“The choice to come up with a new study plan is a ‘problem-focused’ coping technique. Such techniques aim to tackle problems head-on and eliminate the root cause of stress.”\n---\nNeither choice is incorrect. One should try and adopt both emotion-focused and problem-focused coping techniques to deal with stress and to remove the stressors altogether.”",
